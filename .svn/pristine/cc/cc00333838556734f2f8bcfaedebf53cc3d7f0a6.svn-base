For my project I'd like to focus on Course Registration. This will cover the user stories: student adds a class, student requests permission, student searches for a class, student views a course, student views courses, instructor approves a course request. This will require dummy data for courses, students and instructors as well as a stubbed out log in system. This will cover quite a few of the student requirements. It may also make sense to add the ability to drop courses with this functionality.
