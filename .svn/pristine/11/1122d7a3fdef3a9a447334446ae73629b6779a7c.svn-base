# Course Registration (David Hackett)

## Setup

You must have docker [installed](https://www.docker.com/). Both the databases and the app are run using containers.

The app makes use of react so you first need to install the packages for the frontend and build. Start off be going into the frontend directory:

`cd app/frontend`

Then run:
`npm install`

Then:
`npm run build`

Back in main directory (course_registration) run:
`docker compose build --no-cache`

Then to run the project:
`docker compose up`

Before viewing the web app or running tests you need to setup the database.

## Testing

You'll need to run the test commands etc in the app container using the interactive shell.

To do this open a new command window (or tab) and run:
`docker exec -it course-registration-app-dh sh`

Then in the interactive shell first setup the database by running:
`python setup_db.py`

Then run the tests using pytest:
`pytest`

If you make updates using the app or you want to rerun the tests run the setup_db script again. In other words always run setup_db.py before testing.

To exit the interactive shell run:
`exit`

## Viewing the app

Ensure you've setup the db at least once using the instructions from testing.

Navigate to [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/)

## Cleanup

Ctrl-c in the command window running the docker containers you can then run:
`docker compose down -v`
