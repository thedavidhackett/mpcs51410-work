Nice work overall. I took off a view points because
- The bounded contexts seems a bit lacking- namely, I'm not sure where the boundaries themselves here. You may be confused on the goal of this diagram.
- The flask implementation has a decent start in that it loads the database configuration, but there are no routes beyond the dummy route
- There's no testing framework- I could encourage you to adopt a standard testing framework such as pytest.
